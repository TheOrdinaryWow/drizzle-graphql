# Test file patterns - matches vitest configuration
include = ["tests/**/*.test.ts"]

# Test timeout - maintain 100 seconds like vitest (for Docker container startup)
timeout = 100000

# Test isolation (enabled by default in Bun, but being explicit)
# equivalent to vitest's isolate: true

# TypeScript support is built-in for Bun, no additional config needed

# Path resolution - support @/* aliases to src/*
# This replaces the vite-tsconfig-paths plugin functionality

# Improved test runner settings
bail = false # Don't stop on first failure
verbose = true # Show detailed test output
